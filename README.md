# A rookie's pure python MP3 decoder

A pure python implementation **without optimization**.   
Yep, current version is implemented definitely based on the original formulas.
So, it's really slow, but during the journey of implementation I got a deep understanding of MPEG-3 decoder. 
Hope the source code could give you a little bit insight of MP3 codec.
